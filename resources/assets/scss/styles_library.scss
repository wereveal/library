/* Key to working with Bootstrap/Bulma is "simple". Define all variables you
 * want to change before you @use bootstrap/bulma.
 * Everything rests on the !default flag.
 * It means that if a variable already has a value assigned to it,
 * when you try to re-assign it to a variable with !default, it will ignore
 * that assignment. If a variable has an assignment with the !default flag
 * and no value has been assigned, then it will get the new assignment
