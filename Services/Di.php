 *  @brief     Manages Dependency injection / Inversion of Control for the site.
 *  @details   It is expected that this will be initialized in the setup file at
 *             the very begining. All other services needed to be used
 *             throughout the app then get added to it.
 *             This is real basic. You put an instanced service in and pull a service
 *             out. The service must have been instanced already.
